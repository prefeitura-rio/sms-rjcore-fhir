At Rio de Janeiro, we are excited to announce the partnership between Escritorio de Dados (Data Office) and SMS to revolutionize the healthcare system in Rio de Janeiro. Together, they are building a cutting-edge FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) platform that will transform the way healthcare data is managed and shared.

With their combined expertise and resources, we aim to create a comprehensive and efficient healthcare ecosystem for Rio de Janeiro. Our FHIR platform will enable seamless interoperability among healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders, unlocking the potential for improved care coordination, enhanced patient outcomes, and data-driven decision-making.

By leveraging the power of FHIR, we will empower healthcare organizations to securely exchange and access patient data in real-time. This interoperability will foster collaboration, streamline workflows, and ultimately contribute to a more connected and patient-centric healthcare experience in Rio de Janeiro.

Our commitment to data privacy and security is paramount. We adhere to strict regulatory standards and implement robust security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive healthcare information. Trust and privacy are fundamental values in our partnership, and we prioritize the ethical handling of data throughout our FHIR platform.

We are thrilled to embark on this transformative journey with SMS, bringing innovative technology and data-driven solutions to Rio de Janeiro's healthcare landscape. Together, we will drive advancements in healthcare delivery, promote data-driven research, and empower healthcare professionals to provide the highest quality care to the residents of Rio de Janeiro.
